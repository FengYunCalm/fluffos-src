# FluffOS (fork)

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

This repository is a fork of FluffOS focused on build reliability and compiler warning cleanup for modern toolchains, with special attention to Windows/MSYS2 installations.

## What this fork changes

- **Windows install reliability**: `cmake --install` uses `bash cp -f` to overwrite binaries safely and avoid “Permission denied” when replacing `driver.exe` and related tools.
- **Core warning cleanup**: targeted fixes in scratchpad, preprocessor, ed, telnet_ext, external, and socket_efuns.
- **Third-party warning control**: warning suppression and IPO disabled where needed in libevent/crypt/libwebsockets; filesystem CMake minimum version aligned for compatibility.
- **License alignment**: LICENSE/NOTICE added and README updated to reference official FluffOS license sources.

## Build

- Official build guide: https://www.fluffos.info/build.html
- Quick build:

  ```bash
  rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build . --target install
  ```

- Windows/MSYS2 note: ensure `bash` is available in your environment; the install step relies on it for safe binary replacement.
